Cube Wrangler is a Python package that contains utilities for working with Network Wrangler. Cube is a commercial travel modeling software package. Cube Wrangler contains methods for carrying out the following common tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Creates a set of files than can be read in by a Cube script to create a Cube roadway network.</li> <li>Writes out a Network Wrangler transit network in Cube format.  </li> <li>Converts a Cube Log file, which is a record of roadway edits done in Cube, into a Project Card.</li> <li>Converts two Cube <code>LIN</code> files, which are Cube\u2019s way of representing transit, into a Project Card. Note that Cube\u2019s log files do not record transit edits. Rather, Cube writes out an updated <code>LIN</code> file. Cube Wrangler assesses the differences in the <code>LIN</code> files and creates a Project Card that represents the edits.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>[NOT YET IMPLEMENTED]</p> <p>The Cube Wrangler package is available on PyPI.
